# The free-running model
* We don't expect the model to get the weather right, but the climate, i.e. the **statistics** of the weather.
* We can't directly compare to weather observations.

What should we do?

# The free-running model
* We don't expect the model to get the weather right, but the climate, i.e. the **statistics** of the weather.
* We can't directly compare to weather observations.
* We can verify conservation laws, etc.
* We can analyze the behavior.
* Wa can compare statistics to observations.
* We can compare statistics to those of other models.

# What can we compare to?

# What can we compare to?
* Individual measurements
* Satellite data
* Reanalyses

# Verifying conservation laws

# Verifying conservation laws
* Conservation of mass
  * Precipitation - evaporation
  * Ocean water and salt
* Conservation of energy
  * TOA radiation imbalance vs imbalance at surface
  * Ocean energy balance
  * Regional budgets are possible but messy regarding advection.
